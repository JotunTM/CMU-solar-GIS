# CMU-solar-GIS
Resources for CMU's systems synthesis team working on a solar study for the State of PA. 

# Resources

## Tools from the National Renewable Energy Laboratory
### PVWatts Calculator: https://pvwatts.nrel.gov

Search a given location against the National Solar Radiation Database (NSRDB) to calculates hourly or monthly energy production based on information you provide. 

### System Advisor Model (SAM): https://sam.nrel.gov/

Using performance and financial inputs, model a project based on location, components of a system, operating costs and other financial assumptions. More details can be found in the [documentation](https://www.nrel.gov/docs/fy18osti/70414.pdf). 

### NREL Solar Data: https://www.nrel.gov/gis/data-solar.html
Geodatabases, shapefiles and Google Earth compatible files (KMZ) can be found here. 

### NREL Data Visualization and Geospatial Tools: https://www.nrel.gov/gis/tools.html 
An excellent selection of tools, data and other resources.

### OpenEI: https://openei.org/wiki/Main_Page
Crowdsourced information from a variety of sources, also maintained by NREL. 

## Renewables.ninja: https://www.renewables.ninja/
Allows users to input a given location and determine energy output based on a series of sysetm variables.  Map-based.   

Also has example in R using their API and an Excel interface.  https://www.renewables.ninja/news/new-r-and-excel-interfaces

## Consumer-facing tools / metrics by state (from Solar-Estimate.org)
State-level reports and high-level statistics can be found [here](https://www.solar-estimate.org/solar-panels-101#guides), and the PA page is [here](https://www.solar-estimate.org/solar-panels/pennsylvania).

## Solar-GIS: https://solargis.com/maps-and-gis-data/download/usa
Not clear what the value is here in terms of available data, but there are a handful of CONUS maps that might be generally useful.  

They also provide their own tool called iMaps: https://solargis.info/imaps/

## World Bank's Global Solar Atlas: http://globalsolaratlas.info/
Built in collaboration with the folks at Solar-GIS - this version is freely available. 

## EnergyData.Info: https://energydata.info/
Searchable collection of data and applications.
